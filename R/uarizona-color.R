#' # Primary palette
#'
#' * uarizona Blue is our most identifiable colour. It conveys youthfulness,
#' possibility and openness. It should always be considered first.
#' * Black conveys prestige, timelessness and sophistication.
#' * White is often shown as white space and conveys the brand personality
#' of being open and youthful.
#' * Greys can be any percentage of black and provides additional flexibility
#'  to our primary colour palette.
#'
#' The primary colour palette is preferred for digital work.
#'
#' # Secondary palette
#'
#' Inspired by the colours of our academic robes, we have a range of bright,
#' colourful secondary colours.
#'
#' Secondary colours are to be used:
#' * in charts and diagrams to highlight key findings
#' * as headings and subheadings
#' * sparingly to provide highlights or accents â€“ ideally one or two secondary
#' colours per double page spread
#' * to speak to a particular audience group. For instance, colours that would
#' resonate best with our prospective undergraduate audience would be colourful,
#' bright and youthful. Industry and research would suit a more corporate/mature
#' choice to reflect focus and prestige.
